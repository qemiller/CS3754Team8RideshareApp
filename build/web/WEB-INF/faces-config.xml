        This defines 'bundle' as the variable name to use 
        to access the Bundle.properties internationalization file.
        This file allows you to only change one file to change languages. 
        For example, if this was to be used by a French user, the bundle.Properties
        file could be converted into French, and all of the elements that use the bundle
         should be changed to French
