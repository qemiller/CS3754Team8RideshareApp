    The line below informs the surver that we will be accessing files outside the deployed 
    application directory. The 1 next to alternatedocroot specifies this is the first specified
    alternate location. 
    
    This allows the application to both read and write files to this directory. In this case, the
    directory is the folder SurveyUserPhotoStorage in DocRoot. This is where the user photos will
    be stored and accessed
